Please follow the next steps closely in order to prevent any missing settings before you start using Tiptap AI.

Unless you’re an business customer who wants to use [custom resolver functions](/content-ai/custom-llms/integrate), you’ll need to set up your OpenAI keys in your [Tiptap account](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/ai-settings).

## Set up Tiptap AI for your team

This extension relies on using our Content AI backend service. You'll need a valid Entry, Business or Enterprise subscription. [Just head over to our pricing page to learn more.](https://tiptap.dev/pricing)

1.  You’ll need to provide an [OpenAI API token](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/account-setup) yourself, which we’re using in order to send requests to the OpenAI API. Your token is stored well encrypted and is only used on a per-request basis. [Add the OpenAI API Key to your team](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/ai-settings)
2.  Generate a JWT (HS256 algorithm) with our provided secret to authenticate the extension against our service. [Get your JWT secret.](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/ai-settings)
3.  Set up the extension as described below.

## Install the extension

<Callout title="Subscription required" variant="warning">

This extension requires a valid Entry, Business or Enterprise subscription. To install the extension you need access to our [private registry](/guides/pro-extensions), set this up first.

</Callout>

Once done, you can install the extension from our private registry:

```bash
npm install @tiptap-pro/extension-ai
```

## Initialize the extension

The integration into your editor instance is done like every other Tiptap extension. This is an example on how it could look like:

```js
import { useEditor } from '@tiptap/react'
import StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit'
import Ai from '@tiptap-pro/extension-ai'

const editor = useEditor({
  extensions: [
    StarterKit,
    Ai.configure({
      // Your Tiptap Content AI app id
      appId: 'APP_ID_HERE',
      // This needs to be your generated JWT and MUST NOT be the OpenAI API key!
      token: 'TOKEN_HERE',
      autocompletion: true,
      // … other options (see below)
    }),
    // … more extensions
  ],
})
```

At this point you’re good to go to use OpenAI in your Tiptap editor. Have a look at the [configuration options](/content-ai/getting-started/configure) to customize your experience.
