Like other Tiptap AI Extensions, the AI Agent can be used in two ways:

- With Tiptap Cloud: Works out of the box, no server setup required.
- With your own backend: Gives you more control over the AI model and tools.

This guide explains when to use each option:

## Tiptap Cloud

Using the AI Agent with Tiptap Cloud is the easiest and fastest way to get started. It eliminates the need to build and maintain your own server.

With this option, you can still customize how the AI Agent behaves, by editing the [system prompt](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/configure/system-prompt). Thanks to this feature, you can have multiple AI Agent types in your app, each with their own rules and personality.

Providing additional data to the AI Agent is also supported in Tiptap Cloud, by attaching [context](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/features/add-context) to the user messages.

Finally, the Tiptap Cloud option lets you [customize the AI model](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/use-with-content-ai-cloud#customize-the-openai-model). Only OpenAI models are currently supported in Tiptap Cloud.

Using the AI Agent with Tiptap Cloud is recommended for beginners. To get started, [follow this guide](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/use-with-content-ai-cloud).

## Custom backend

<Callout title="Beginner's tip" variant="info">
  Using the AI Agent for the first time? We recommend you to set it up with Tiptap Cloud first, and
  then migrate to a custom backend when you need more features. The migration process is seamless
  and requires no changes to the original client code.
</Callout>

Using a custom backend gives you more control but requires more work to set up and maintain. Use it in these situations:

- To use an AI model provider that is not supported in Tiptap Cloud. Currently, only OpenAI models are supported in Tiptap Cloud.
- If you need to define custom tools for the AI Agent to call, these can be:
  - Tools to interact with the document. For example, a tool that formats the document.
  - Data retrieval tools. For example, a tool that returns the weather forecast.
  - Orchestration tools. For example, a tool that delegates the work to another AI Agent or workflow.

Also use a custom backend if you have already built an AI Agent and want to integrate it with Tiptap's text editing tools. The Tiptap AI Agent extension can connect to your existing AI Agent by calling the backend service where the AI Agent is hosted.
