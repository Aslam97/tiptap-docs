This guide explains how to set up the AI Agent extension with a custom backend.

The guide has different versions depending on the AI library you use. We currently support the following libraries:

- [Vercel AI SDK](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms/install/vercel-ai-sdk)
- [OpenAI (Chat completions API)](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms/install/openai)
- [OpenAI (Responses API)](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms/install/openai)
- [Anthropic (Claude Messages API)](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms/install/openai)

Don't know which library to use? We recommend you to start with the [Vercel AI SDK](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms/install/vercel-ai-sdk). It lets you switch between different AI model providers, so you can try which one works best for you.
