Tiptap’s AI Agent extension comes in two flavors, so you can decide how much you want to build yourself:

1. **Drop-in AI Agent** – a [fully wired assistant](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/install) that you can embed in any Tiptap editor (and the rest of your stack) in minutes. It already knows how to read, plan, and edit rich-text documents, so you ship faster.
2. **Agentic tools for your own agent** – a [modular toolbox](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms/overview) that upgrades an existing LLM-powered assistant. Add precise document-reading, structured text-editing actions, and planning helpers that respect the editor’s state. Combine these tools with your own to design bespoke workflows.

Both options share the same foundations: modular design, clear extension points, and performance tuned for large documents. Pick the path that fits your architecture and keep the freedom to switch or extend later.

The AI Agent extension lets you build an AI Assistant that can read, answer questions, and edit your document based on a user-defined task.

  Give it text-editing superpowers with Tiptap&apos;s AI Agent extension. It provides it the tools

</Callout>

## Key features

- Is aware of the editor's selected content.
- Let your users review and accept/reject AI-generated changes.

## Use Tiptap's AI Agent — or build your own

There are two ways to use the AI Agent extension:

- [Use it with Tiptap Cloud](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/use-with-content-ai-cloud), which provides a managed, ready-to-use AI Agent.
- [Add it to your existing AI Agent](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms), that's hosted in your backend.

## What are AI Agents?

AI Agents are systems that can accomplish a complex task by making independent decisions. Unlike simple chatbot assistants, AI Agents can not only respond with text, but also call "tools" that let them interact with the environment.

The Tiptap AI Agent extension provides AI Agents the tools to perform these actions:

- Read the document
- Re-write the document's contents
- Make a plan, interact with the user, and create a summary of the changes it made.

These built-in tools are optimized for rich text editing and follow LLM best practices, allowing you to focus on your application's core logic. You can combine them with custom tools for data retrieval.

When an LLM is called with these tools, it selects one to execute. Then, the Tiptap AI Agent Extension applies it to the editor, modifying the document or reading its content in an efficient way. In a typical implementation, the LLM is called on the server, while the document editing happens in the browser.

Think of the LLM as the "brain" of the AI Agent, making decisions about which tools to call. The Tiptap AI Agent Extension acts as the "hands" and "eyes," enabling the agent to read and interact with the document.

By using the AI Agent extension with Tiptap Cloud, you don't need to worry about the server — we have it built for you. However, if you want to customize the LLM and the tools that the AI Agent has available (so that it can perform other actions, like searching an external data source), you can integrate the AI Agent extension with your own backend.
