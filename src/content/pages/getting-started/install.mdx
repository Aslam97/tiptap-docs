## Integrating the Pages extension

After installing the `pages` extension, register it in your editor by adding the `Pages` extension to your editor’s `extensions` array.

```js
import { Pages } from '@tiptap-pro/extension-pages'

const editor = new Editor({
  ...
  extensions: [
    ...,
    Pages,
  ]
})
```

Depending on your use case, you may need to configure a collaborative provider or additional options. Refer to the full documentation for advanced configuration.
