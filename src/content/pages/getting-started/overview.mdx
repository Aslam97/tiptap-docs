Tiptap Pages is a powerful extension that transforms your editing experience from a traditional single-block editor into a sophisticated page-based interface.

<CodeDemo isPro src="https://deploy-preview-369--tiptap-pro.netlify.app/preview/extensions/pages" />

With Pages, you can create documents that feel more like real pages, complete with proper margins, page breaks, and layout controls. This makes it perfect for creating documents that need to maintain a professional, page-based structure â€“ whether you're working on reports, articles, or any other content that benefits from a traditional document format.
