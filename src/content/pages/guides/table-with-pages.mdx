To add tables to your paginated editor, you should use the Table extension included in the Pages package. This ensures full compatibility with pagination as in order to properly split tables across the pages we needed to heavily modify the behavior and layout of tables.

---

## 1. Install the Table extension (included with Pages)

If you already have the Pages extension installed, you do not need to install a separate Table package. The compatible Table extension is included.

## 2. Import and add Table to your editor

```js
import { Editor } from '@tiptap/core'
import StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit'
import { Pages, Table } from '@tiptap-pro/extension-pages'

const editor = new Editor({
  extensions: [
    StarterKit,
    Pages.configure({ /* ... */ }),
    Table,
  ],
})
```

<Callout title="Best practice" variant="info">
  Always use the Table extension from <code>@tiptap-pro/extension-pages</code> when working with Pages. Do not use the open source Table extension, as it's not compatible with the layout generated by the Pages extension.
</Callout>

## 3. Table features
- The exposed Table extension works and behaves exactly like the open-source one and can also be extended to make it fit your needs.
- Tables will paginate correctly and export to DOCX with your document

<Callout title="Extending the Page's Table extension" variant="default">
  Be careful when extending the Table extension exposed by the Pages package as it's layout its heavily modified and you can potentially break the table splitting logic.
</Callout>
