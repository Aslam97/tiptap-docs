## When I copy the content of the editor, into a text field I get a bunch of newlines

By default, in Tiptap, the clipboard text serializer is set to produce paragraphs with 2 newlines in between (like you would do in Markdown).

So you'd paste content and it would look like this:

```text
This is a paragraph.

This is another paragraph.
```

When you probably want it to look like this:

```text
This is a paragraph.
This is another paragraph.
```

To do this you have to change the `clipboardTextSerializer` to use a single newline instead of two.

Like this:

```js
new Editor({
  // other options
  coreExtensionOptions: {
    clipboardTextSerializer: {
      blockSeparator: '\n',
    },
  },
})
```

Which will make the clipboard serializer use a single newline as a separator between blocks.

## Why can't I use React context within a nodeView

NodeViews have to be handed off to ProseMirror, which means they can't be structured like a typical React component. The `<NodeViewContent>` is serving as a div to mount elements into, but does not render the children as a React component would. Therefore, React context does not work within a NodeView.
