## When I copy the content of the editor, into a text field I get a bunch of newlines

By default, in Tiptap, the clipboard text serializer is set to produce paragraphs with 2 newlines in between (like you would do in Markdown).

So you'd paste content and it would look like this:

```text
This is a paragraph.

This is another paragraph.
```

When you probably want it to look like this:

```text
This is a paragraph.
This is another paragraph.
```

To do this you have to change the `clipboardTextSerializer` to use a single newline instead of two.

Like this:

```js
new Editor({
  // other options
  coreExtensionOptions: {
    clipboardTextSerializer: {
      blockSeparator: '\n',
    },
  },
})
```

Which will make the clipboard serializer use a single newline as a separator between blocks.

## I'm having issues with React context with NodeViews

To use React context within a NodeView, you need to wrapp the EditorContent component with the context provider. Within the nodeview, the context should be available within the NodeView component.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { EditorContent } from '@tiptap/react'

const TiptapEditor = ({ editor }) => {
  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={{ foo: 'bar' }}>
      <EditorContent editor={editor} />
    </MyContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

## Drag & Drop isn't working

Some libraries like react-dnd or react-beautiful-dnd might interfere with the drag & drop functionality of Tiptap. If you're using one of these libraries, you might have to disable them (or at least confine the elements that they listen to) for the drag and drop functionality of the editor to work properly.

## Why `parseHTML` and `renderHTML`

`parseHTML` is taking the HTML represenation and parsing that as JSON.

`renderHTML` is taking the JSON representation and outputting that as HTML to render in the editor.

So `parseHTML` and `renderHTML` can be thought of as opposites:

 - `parseHTML`: HTML -> JSON
 - `renderHTML`: JSON -> HTML

`renderHTML` is used during copy events, becasue what you copy from an editor needs to be serialized as HTML to go into your clipboard.
`parseHTML` is used during paste events, because that HTML in your clipboard is serialized as HTML and needs to be parsed into JSON.

On initial render, if your content is defined as JSON, `parseHTML` is completely skipped, and would only be used for pastes.
Whereas your `renderHTML` method determines how the content is represented within the editor.
